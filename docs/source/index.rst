Welcome to ISSPA's documentation!
===================================

**ISSPA (Intelligent Self-driving System empowering Physical Agent)** is an experimental platform for 
self-driving physical agents, which was originally designed to facilitate researchers by creating a 
baseline library that is easy to use, algorithmically verifiable, and modularly extensible. And it was 
built under the leadership of the `TIS Lab <https://tis.ios.ac.cn/>`_, of which the team members 
are listed in :doc:`team`.

It has the following features:

- Some open source baseline frameworks for autonomous driving.

- A cloud platform that supports the remote use of physical vehicles.
